# visual-analytics
This repository contains my visual analytics portfolio assignments. Please enter the separate folders to see readme's, python scripts, requirements, bash scripts and data for each assignment.

I wasn't sure where (or how, I'm very bad at github) to put the utils folder from the main cds-visual github repository, so here's a link to it: https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-visual/tree/main/utils 

**NB:**
First of all, I want to say thank you to Ross for this course, I know it probably hasn't been a great experience for you to teach this course, but you have still done it very well under the circumstances. I haven't been very active, because I have serious wrist problems and have been told by my doctor not to code more than strictly necessary for me to pass these courses (and I wasn't allowed by the university to change elective, even though I was supposed to have gone on exchange and thus hadn't planned on taking these courses in the first place, which also hasn't contributed to my motivation).
