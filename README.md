# visual-analytics
This repository contains my visual analytics portfolio assignments. Please enter the separate folders to see readme's, python scripts, requirements, bash scripts and data for each assignment.

I wasn't sure where (or how, I'm very bad at github) to put the utils folder from the main cds-visual github repository, so here's a link to it: https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-visual/tree/main/utils 

**NB:**
First of all, I want to say thank you to Ross for teaching this course, I know it probably hasn't been a great experience for you due to the online format, but you have still done a fantastic job. I am sorry that I haven't been very active; I have serious wrist problems and have been told by my doctor not to code more than strictly necessary for me to pass these courses (I was told by my study councelor that I wasn't allowed by the university to change elective, even though I was supposed to have been on exchange and thus hadn't planned to take these courses).
