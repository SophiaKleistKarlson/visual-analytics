For this assignment, I use data from my bachelor thesis. The images are produced by a linear transmission study where each participant copied the drawings produced by the last participant. The experiment had 20 chains of 7 generations with 12 different images copied by each participant, amounting to 1680 images. The hypothesis was that the drawings would become simpler and more conventional through copying; something that the results indicated. For this assignment, I am looking at whether the amount of lines also changed through generations; each source image consisted of 4 lines before being copied by the first participant (who represents generation 0) – I hypothesize that they might end up with less, as an indicator of gained simplicity.
